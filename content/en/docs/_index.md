### The Power of Hops for Better Sleep and Dreams

Hops, a natural herb commonly known for its use in brewing beer, is also a powerful ally in promoting restful sleep and vivid dreams. Belonging to the same plant family as marijuana, hops contain compounds that help calm the nervous system, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep quality. 

By incorporating hops into your nightly routine—whether through teas, supplements, or aromatherapy—you can unlock its potential to enhance relaxation and support deeper, more restorative sleep. This natural remedy has been used for centuries to help individuals achieve a peaceful night's rest and even experience more vivid and meaningful dreams.
