Aromatherapy with hops is a natural way to promote relaxation and prepare your body for restful sleep. The soothing scent of hops can help calm the mind and reduce stress at bedtime.

### Methods of Hops Aromatherapy

- **Essential Oil Diffusers:** Add a few drops of hops essential oil to a diffuser to fill your room with a calming aroma.
- **Warm Baths:** Add hops essential oil or dried hops flowers to a warm bath for a relaxing soak.
- **Hop Pillows:** Place a hop pillow near your head or inside your pillowcase to gently release the aroma of hops throughout the night.

### Hop Pillows: A Key Aromatherapy Product

Hop pillows are small sachets filled with dried hops flowers, sometimes blended with other calming herbs like lavender. They are designed to be placed on or near your pillow, allowing you to inhale the relaxing scent as you fall asleep. Hop pillows are a convenient, natural, and non-invasive way to enjoy the benefits of hops aromatherapy every night.

**Benefits of Hop Pillows:**
