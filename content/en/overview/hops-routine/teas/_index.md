## Hops Teas: A Soothing Nightly Ritual

Hops teas are a gentle and effective way to incorporate the calming properties of hops into your nightly routine. The process of brewing and sipping a warm cup of hops tea can help signal to your body that it’s time to unwind.

### How Hops Teas Work

Hops flowers contain natural compounds, such as humulene and lupuline, that interact with the nervous system to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. When brewed as a tea, these compounds are gently extracted, making them easy for your body to absorb.

### Preparing Hops Tea

**Ingredients:**
- 1–2 teaspoons dried hops flowers
- Optional: chamomile, lavender, or lemon balm for added flavor and relaxation

**Instructions:**
1. Place hops flowers (and any additional herbs) in a tea infuser or teapot.
2. Pour 8 ounces of hot (not boiling) water over the herbs.
3. Steep for 5–10 minutes, depending on desired strength.
4. Strain and enjoy 30–60 minutes before bedtime.

### Tips for Enjoying Hops Tea

- Hops tea can be quite bitter; adding honey or blending with sweeter herbs can improve the taste.
- Start with a small amount to gauge your body’s response.
- Make it a calming ritual by pairing your tea with quiet activities like reading or meditation.

### The Role of Teas in Your Nightly Routine

Regularly drinking hops tea can help establish a consistent bedtime routine, signaling to your mind and body that it’s time to relax and prepare for restful sleep.
