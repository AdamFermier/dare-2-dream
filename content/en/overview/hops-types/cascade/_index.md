## History & Development

Cascade hops were developed by the USDA breeding program at Oregon State University and released in 1971. Named after the Cascade mountain range, this variety revolutionized the American craft brewing industry and remains one of the most widely grown aroma hops in the United States.

### Genetic Background
- **Parent Varieties**: Fuggle × Russian Serebrianker
- **Scientific Name**: _Humulus lupulus_ 'Cascade'
- **Breeding Program**: USDA-ARS, OSU
- **Ploidy**: Tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40)

## Chemical Composition

### Key Aroma Compounds
- **Total Oil Content**: 0.8-2.5 mL/100g
- **Primary Terpenes**:
  - Myrcene (45-60%)
  - Humulene (8-13%)
  - Farnesene (3-7%)
  - Caryophyllene (5-9%)

### Distinctive Aromatics
Cascade's signature floral-citrus profile comes from specific compounds:
- **Geraniol**: Floral, rose-like notes
- **Linalool**: Lavender, floral undertones
- **Citronellol**: Citrus, lemon characteristics
- **Beta-pinene**: Pine, herbal notes

## Medicinal Properties

### Sedative Components
- **Alpha Acids**: 4.5-7.0%
- **Beta Acids**: 4.8-7.0%
- **Xanthohumol**: 0.2-0.4%

### Calming Effects
The combination of myrcene and humulene contributes to Cascade's mild sedative properties, making it suitable for sleep and anxiety support.

## Cultivation & Growth

- **Growth Habit**: Vigorous climber
- **Maturity**: Mid-season
- **Disease Resistance**: 
  - Tolerant to downy mildew
  - Moderate resistance to powdery mildew
  - Susceptible to Verticillium wilt

## Research Applications

Recent studies have focused on:
- Terpene synthesis pathways
- Genetic markers for aroma traits
- Environmental impacts on oil composition
- Therapeutic potential of specific compounds
