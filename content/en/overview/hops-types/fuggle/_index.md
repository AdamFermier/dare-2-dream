## History & Development

Fuggle hops are a cornerstone of English brewing, first discovered in 1861 by Richard Fuggle in Kent, England, and released commercially in 1875. Fuggle quickly became the dominant aroma hop in the UK and is still prized for its classic, earthy character in traditional British ales and porters.

### Genetic Background
- **Parent Variety**: English landrace (possible wild hop cross)
- **Scientific Name**: _Humulus lupulus_ 'Fuggle'
- **Region of Origin**: Kent, England
- **Ploidy**: Diploid (2n = 2x = 20)

## Chemical Composition

### Key Aroma Compounds
- **Total Oil Content**: 0.7-1.4 mL/100g
- **Primary Terpenes**:
  - Myrcene (20-30%)
  - Humulene (20-30%)
  - Caryophyllene (8-12%)
  - Farnesene (2-5%)

### Distinctive Aromatics
Fuggleâ€™s aroma profile is known for:
- **Humulene**: Woody, herbal, and spicy notes
- **Caryophyllene**: Peppery, earthy undertones
- **Selinene**: Subtle, woody character
- **Linalool**: Mild floral notes

## Medicinal Properties

### Traditional Components
- **Alpha Acids**: 3.5-6.0%
- **Beta Acids**: 2.0-3.0%
- **Polyphenols**: 4.0-5.5%
- **Total Essential Oils**: 0.7-1.4%

### Therapeutic Applications
Historically, Fuggle hops have been used for:
- Mild sedative effects
- Relief of anxiety and restlessness
- Digestive support
- Antimicrobial properties

## Cultivation & Terroir

- **Growth Habit**: Moderate vigor
- **Maturity**: Mid to late season
- **Climate Requirements**:
  - Maritime temperate climate
  - Well-drained soils
- **Disease Resistance**:
  - Moderate resistance to downy mildew
  - Susceptible to Verticillium wilt and powdery mildew

## Authentication & Preservation

- Maintained as a heritage variety in the UK
- DNA fingerprinting for varietal purity
- Preservation of traditional cultivation practices

## Current Research

Research areas include:
- Genetic mapping for disease resistance
- Terroir influence on oil composition
- Impact of climate change on aroma profile
- Medicinal potential of specific terpenes
