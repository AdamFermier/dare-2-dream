## History & Development

Nugget hops were developed by the USDA breeding program in Corvallis, Oregon, and released in 1983. Bred as a high alpha acid, dual-purpose hop, Nugget quickly became popular in both commercial and craft brewing for its robust bitterness and unique herbal aroma.

### Genetic Background
- **Parentage**: Brewers Gold × (Early Green × Canterbury Golding)
- **Scientific Name**: _Humulus lupulus_ 'Nugget'
- **Breeding Program**: USDA-ARS, Oregon State University
- **Ploidy**: Diploid (2n = 2x = 20)

## Chemical Composition

### Key Aroma Compounds
- **Total Oil Content**: 1.5-2.3 mL/100g
- **Primary Terpenes**:
  - Myrcene (47-52%)
  - Humulene (12-20%)
  - Caryophyllene (7-10%)
  - Farnesene (<1%)

### Distinctive Aromatics
Nugget’s aroma profile is characterized by:
- **Myrcene**: Herbal, resinous, and slightly citrusy
- **Humulene**: Woody, spicy, and earthy notes
- **Caryophyllene**: Peppery, herbal undertones
- **Linalool**: Subtle floral hints

## Medicinal Properties

### Traditional Components
- **Alpha Acids**: 12.0-14.5%
- **Beta Acids**: 4.0-6.0%
- **Polyphenols**: 4.0-5.5%
- **Total Essential Oils**: 1.5-2.3%

### Therapeutic Applications
Nugget hops have been studied for:
- Antioxidant properties
- Mild sedative effects
- Antimicrobial activity
- Potential anti-inflammatory benefits

## Cultivation & Terroir

- **Growth Habit**: Vigorous, high-yielding
- **Maturity**: Mid to late season
- **Climate Requirements**:
  - Adaptable to various climates
  - Prefers well-drained soils
- **Disease Resistance**:
  - Good resistance to downy mildew
  - Moderate resistance to powdery mildew
  - Susceptible to Verticillium wilt

## Authentication & Preservation

- Maintained in USDA and commercial breeding collections
- DNA fingerprinting for varietal identification
- Ongoing breeding for improved disease resistance

## Current Research

Research areas include:
- Optimization of alpha acid content
- Terpene synthesis and aroma enhancement
- Disease resistance breeding
- Health-promoting properties of hop compounds
